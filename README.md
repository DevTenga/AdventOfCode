## DevTenga

Hello! üëã I am <a href = "https://github.com/DevTenga">DevTenga/Anurag Tewary</a>, a 16-year-old Indian programming enthusiast. I recently came to know about the annual programming event, <a href = "https://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>. So, here are my solutions for Advent Of Code, 2021. <br>

They are written in <a href = "http://lua.org">Lua 5.3</a>. Advent of Code has been really useful to me. It helped me learn a lot of new programming concepts and also challenge my programming skill. I thank all the developers who made advent of code possible. ‚ù§Ô∏è
